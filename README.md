# Vision | The Future of Programming

Vision is a *dynamically typed, multi paradigm, interpreted* programming language written in Python, which is used to match the simplicity of python along with inculcating the good habits of other statically typed languages like C/C++, Java and Typescript.

It is generally used to make low level functionality much more easier and fun to write while also being a good choice for beginners. As inspired from its name, and the oncoming of Web 3 or possible Web 5 in the future. We want to be future ready to interact with the Tech efficiently.

In the oncoming v1.0.0 of Vision, we are introducing a new concept of Adders (Extension Data Types)

## Usage/Examples

```vision
fun main() {
    let name:string = "Hello World"
    conval pi:int = 3.14
    writeln(name,pi)
 }
```
```
fun main() {
    let num:adder - inf
    conval age:adder twenty-four
}
```
